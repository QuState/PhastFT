# PhastFT

PhastFT is a high-performance, "quantum-inspired" Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) library written in safe Rust.

Designed for large FFTs (gigabytes of data) common in scientific workloads, e.g. in quantum computer simulators.

## Features

- Performance competitive with other Rust implementations in a single thread, and much faster when multi-threaded
- In-place algorithm for low memory usage, allows running large FFTs on cheaper hardware
- Simple implementation using the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm and [CO-BRAVO](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1248377.1248411) bit reversal
- No `unsafe` code
- Optional multi-threading
- SIMD acceleration on SSE4.2, AVX2, NEON and WASM thanks to [`fearless_simd`](https://crates.io/crates/fearless_simd)
- Selects the fastest SIMD implementation at runtime. No need for `-C target-cpu=native`!
- Coming soon: Python bindings (via [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3))

## Limitations

- The fastest path (`fft_*_dit`) requires a power-of-two length. For other
  lengths, the `fft_*_bluestein` family computes the same DFT with Bluestein's
  algorithm. Callers do not need to pad their input, but the transform is slower
  and uses an internal convolution buffer.

## Planned features

- A real-input (R2C-style) Bluestein path, and a smart entry point that auto-selects the power-of-2 or Bluestein transform by size
- Even more work on performance

## Quickstart
```rust
use phastft::{fft_f64_dit, fft_f64_dit_with_planner, planner::{Direction, PlannerDit64}};

let big_n = 1 << 20;
let mut reals: Vec<f64> = (1..=big_n).map(|i| i as f64).collect();
let mut imags: Vec<f64> = (1..=big_n).map(|i| i as f64).collect();

// Simple API
fft_f64_dit(&mut reals, &mut imags, Direction::Forward);

// Or with a reusable planner for better performance with multiple FFTs
let planner = PlannerDit64::new(big_n);
fft_f64_dit_with_planner(&mut reals, &mut imags, Direction::Forward, &planner);
```

### Arbitrary-size FFT (Bluestein)

For lengths that are not a power of two, use the `fft_*_bluestein` family. It has
the same three tiers and `Direction` semantics as `fft_*_dit`. A reusable
`PlannerBluestein64` amortizes the chirp table and convolution-kernel precompute.

```rust,no_run
use phastft::{
    fft_f64_bluestein,
    fft_f64_bluestein_with_planner,
    planner::{Direction, PlannerBluestein64},
};

let n = 1_003; // prime; no caller-side padding needed
let mut reals: Vec<f64> = (1..=n).map(|i| i as f64).collect();
let mut imags: Vec<f64> = vec![0.0; n];

// Simple API
fft_f64_bluestein(&mut reals, &mut imags, Direction::Forward);

// Or reuse a planner across many transforms of the same size
let planner = PlannerBluestein64::new(n);
fft_f64_bluestein_with_planner(&mut reals, &mut imags, Direction::Inverse, &planner);
```

For an allocation-free hot path, use
`fft_f64_bluestein_with_planner_and_opts` and keep two scratch buffers of at
least `planner.scratch_len()` elements each. Choose `Options` for that scratch
length, which is also the size of the internal power-of-two FFT.

### Complex number support (interleaved format)

When the `complex-nums` feature is enabled, you can also use the interleaved
format with the `num_complex::Complex` type:

```rust,ignore
use phastft::{
    planner::Direction,
    fft_f64_dit_interleaved
};
use num_complex::Complex;

let big_n = 1 << 10;
let mut signal: Vec<Complex<f64>> = (1..=big_n)
    .map(|i| Complex::new(i as f64, i as f64))
    .collect();
fft_f64_dit_interleaved(&mut signal, Direction::Forward);
```

Both `fft_f32_dit_interleaved` and `fft_f64_dit_interleaved` are available for `f32` and
`f64` precision respectively.

### Real-valued FFT (R2C)

For purely real-valued input, the R2C transform is approximately 2x faster than
running a full complex FFT with zeroed imaginary components. The output is the
*compact* `N/2 + 1` complex spectrum. The remaining `N/2 - 1` bins can be
derived via the conjugate symmetry `X[N - k] = conj(X[k])`.

The bare `r2c_fft_f64` / `c2r_fft_f64` build a planner (and, for C2R, scratch
buffers) for you. R2C is in-place — the output buffers double as scratch for the
inner half-length complex FFT.

```rust
use phastft::{c2r_fft_f64, r2c_fft_f64};

let n = 1 << 16;
let signal: Vec<f64> = (0..n).map(|i| (i as f64).sin()).collect();

// Forward real FFT — the compact N/2 + 1 spectrum.
let mut spec_re = vec![0.0; n / 2 + 1];
let mut spec_im = vec![0.0; n / 2 + 1];
r2c_fft_f64(&signal, &mut spec_re, &mut spec_im);

// Inverse — recover the N real samples.
let mut recovered = vec![0.0; n];
c2r_fft_f64(&spec_re, &spec_im, &mut recovered);
```

For repeated transforms of the same size, reuse a `PlannerR2c64` via
`r2c_fft_f64_with_planner` / `c2r_fft_f64_with_planner`, or take full control of
options and C2R scratch buffers with the `_with_planner_and_opts` tier.

### Normalization

`phastft` only scales the output of the inverse FFT. Namely, running IFFT(x)
will scale each element by `1/N`, where `N` is the number of data points, and
`IFFT(FFT(x)) == x`. If your use case(s) require(s) something different, please
don't hesitate to create an issue.

### Bit Reversal and Output Order

- Input: Normal order (bit-reversed internally)
- Output: Normal order
- Bit Reversal: Always performed on input (required for correctness)

## Performance Notes

**Reuse planners.** If you're doing multiple FFTs of the same size, create the planner once and reuse it.

**Threading.** If the `parallel` feature is enabled, the library uses 2 threads for bit reversal and all available threads for FFT calculation when it seems profitable.

**Complex numbers.** The separate real/imaginary array API is faster and uses less memory than the interleaved complex API which allocates temporary buffers.

## Benchmarks

PhastFT is benchmarked against several other FFT libraries. The plots below show
PhastFT with the `parallel` feature enabled (multi-threaded) against RustFFT and
FFTW3. The single-threaded comparison, along with the scripts and instructions to
reproduce every result, lives in the [benchmarks
README](https://github.com/smu160/PhastFT/tree/main/benches#readme).

## How is it so fast?

PhastFT is designed around the capabilities and limitations of modern hardware
(that is, anything made in the last 10 years or so).

The two major bottlenecks in FFT are the **CPU cycles** and **memory accesses**.

Most literature on FFT focuses on reducing the amount of arithmetic operations,
but today's CPUs are heavily memory-bottlenecked for any amount of data that
doesn't fit into the cache. It doesn't matter how much or how little CPU
instructions you need to execute if the CPU spends most of the time just
waiting on memory anyway!

[Notes on FFTs for implementers](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2023/03/19/notes-on-ffts-for-implementers/) is a good read
if you want to understand the trade-offs on modern hardware. Its author is not affiliated with PhastFT.

The trade-offs we chose are:

- **In-place** FFT with a separate bit-reversal step reduces memory traffic and peak memory usage compared to out-of-place and auto-sorter FFTs
- **Radix-2** Cooley-Tukey FFT: radix-4 and split-radix do less math, but require complex and slow bit reversals.
  - We still need to experiment with fusing multiple radix-2 passes to reduce memory traffic in single-threaded scenarios
- [**CO-BRAVO**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1248377.1248411) cache-optimal, SIMD-accelerated bit reversal trounces other algorithms.
- **Decimation in time** maps better to SIMD fused multiply-adds than decimation-in-frequency, and CO-BRAVO makes skipping bit reversal less appealing.
- **Recursive formulation** enables cache-oblivious FFT and easy parallelism. We switch over to a loop when reaching L1 cache size.

All of this combined results in a fast and efficient FFT implementation competitive with
the performance of existing Rust FFT crates on medium to large sizes, while using significantly less memory.

## PhastFT vs. RustFFT

[RustFFT](https://crates.io/crates/rustfft/) is another excellent FFT
implementation in pure Rust. RustFFT and PhastFT make different trade-offs.

### PhastFT advantages

 - Up to 2x lower memory usage, letting you use laptops or cheaper cloud instances for large FFTs
 - Multi-threading support, much higher performance on large sizes when using multi-threading
 - No `unsafe` code

### RustFFT advantages

 - Higher performance for small sizes thanks to dedicated handwritten kernels for each size
 - Supports FFT sizes that aren't powers of 2 (with a large performance penalty)

## What's with the name?

The name, **PhastFT**, is derived from the implementation of the
[Quantum Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform) (QFT). Namely, the
[quantum circuit implementation of QFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform#Circuit_implementation)
consists of the **P**hase gates and **H**adamard gates. Hence, **Ph**astFT.
